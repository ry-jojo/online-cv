        link: "#"
       tagline: "Under weakly supervised condition, a novel unified mutual learning framework is proposed, which complement the adavantages of both tree-graph matching and structured sparsity to fully exploit the spatial information of hierarchical structures and accomplish the task of image cosegmentation.
                 Two strategies, active node and tree reconstruction, are proposed to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the proposed framework. The active node strategy is capable of saving half of the computational time with no influences of the cosegmentation results. Meanwhile, the tree reconstruction strategy effectively improve the representation ability of the hierarchical tree structures of images."
