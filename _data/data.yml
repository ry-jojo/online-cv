    title: Career Profile
    text: "My undergraduate course on pattern recognition lit my passion for research. After I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Intelligent Engineering (2011), I directly became a PhD candidate and obtained a doctoral degree from the school of artificial intelligence, Xidian University, China (2018). In 2019, I joined RR@NTU as a research scientist in Singapore. The half-business and half-academic working environments of RR@NTU helped me grow both professionally and personally. At the beginning of 2022, I started my new journey with SCRIPT@NTU. My current research interests include few-shot object detection for images/videos (FSOD), few-shot instance segmentation for images/videos (FSIS), 3D Steganography and optimization algorithms for power management systems (PMS)."

    experiences:
        - role: MARINE POWER SYSTEM DESIGN AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT
          company: 2019 -- 2022
          details: Her primary research focusses on few-shot learning, particularly in scenarios with limited annotated data. Many privacy-preserving applications encounter challenges due to the lack of sufficient data, such as privacy-sensitive images or objects in surveillance systems, or privacy-preserving object detection for medical image analysis. Few-shot learning shows promise in such cases, where the availability of labelled data is restricted, or privacy concerns prevent the collection and sharing of sensitive data.
        
        - role: WEAKLY SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED COMMONALITY ANALYSIS 
          #time: 2017 - present
          company: 2017 - 2019
          details: A first comprehensive survey covering both image and video cosegmentation is proposed, which are two newly emerged and under developed fields under the domain of image processing and video understanding

        - role: IMAGE COSEGMENTATION WITH WEIGHTED TREE STRUCTURED SPARSITY
          #time: 2014 - 2015
          company: 2013 - 2017
          details: Under weakly supervised condition, a novel unified mutual learning framework is proposed, which complement the adavantages of both tree-graph matching and structured sparsity to fully exploit the spatial information of hierarchical structures and accomplish the task of image cosegmentation.
        
        - role: ROTATION INVARIANT OBJECT DETECTION and LOCALIZATION
